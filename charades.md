# Charades - RW version

A multi-activity party game for you and your friends! Guess the word on the card that’s on your head from your friends’ clues before the timer runs out!

## Features

* draw new card by tilting phone
* timer
* draw cards from different decks

## Implementation
* choose from deck of cards
* user A holds phone to forehead and user B helps user A guess the word on the deck
* if user A guesses right, tilt front - correct
* if user A guesses wrong, tilt back - pass
* timer (eg 30 sec) keeps track of how many correct guesses

### Tools
* Seems like android apps are easier to make - not sure
* [Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZWNXsjIvrE) - this could be how we do the tilting

### Notes
* Making decks of cards + timer is the easiest part
* Personally (Gaju) more comfortable in Pyton or C++
* No idea how to do the tilting part
